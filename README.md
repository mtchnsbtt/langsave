# langsave
A Language Documentation Project
LangSaver is an iOS Shortcut I put together to quickly document and preserve languages and language data. 
It very quickly records text, images, video, or audio (depending on menu choices) and organizes the data to make an folder with all media along with a .csv file that matches recordings with translations.

If you wish to try out LangSaver - download the file in my repository on an iOS device and give it a shot!

Requirements:
- an iOS Device - (iPhone, iPad, etc)
- External Microphone - (OPTIONAL)

If you wish to contact me, you can use GitHub and I am on Twitter @themitchnesbitt.

I'll update this as soon as I can.

DIRECTIONS
1. "What is the language you are starting with?" - L1
2. "What language are you translating?" - L2
3. Choose from the following options on the menu:

NOTE: (The menu in LangSaver uses Emojis to save space. So this is an approximation).
   1 - Audio+Image+Text
   2 - Audio+Photo only (no text)
   3 - Audio (L1 Text/L2 NoText)
   4 - Auio ONLY (no text or images for L1/L2)
   5 - L1 Text/L2 GIF (this is for sign languages)
   6 - Passage in L2 (NO Translation)

A Language Documentation Project
LangSaver is an iOS Shortcut I put together to quickly document and preserve languages and language data. 
It very quickly records text, images, video, or audio (depending on menu choices) and organizes the data to make an folder with all media along with a .txt file that matches recordings with translations.

The .txt files has each value separated by commas (,) and with every entry separated by lines. If you convert the .txt file into a .csv, you have a spreadsheet dictionary/corpus/lexicon of all the recordings and media.

If you wish to try out LangSaver - download the file in my repository on an iOS device and give it a shot!

Requirements:
- an iOS Device - (iPhone, iPad, etc)
- Shortcuts on iOS
  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8
- External Microphone (OPTIONAL)

DIRECTIONS - 
1. Install Shortcuts
2. Download LangSaver from GitHub.
3. When you upen langsaver for the 1st time, the menu should appear with options like [Language1] and [Language2]. You have to touch "cancel" and then touch "edit" in the upper left corner to make LangSaver display the names of the languages you want. [Language1] should be the system language, and [Language2] should be the targety of study. After editing, touch "Done".
4. Open LangSaver again, and begin the process.

NOTE: (The menu in LangSaver uses Emojis to save space. So this is an approximation).

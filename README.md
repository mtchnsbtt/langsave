# langsave
A Language Documentation Project
LangSaver is an iOS Shortcut I put together to quickly document and preserve languages and language data. 
It very quickly records text, images, video, or audio (depending on menu choices) and organizes the data to make an folder with all media along with a .csv file that matches recordings with translations.

If you wish to try out LangSaver - download the file in my repository on an iOS device and give it a shot!

Requirements:
an iOS Device - (iPhone, iPad, etc)
Optionally - You can connect an external microphone to improve audio quality - but it's not needed.

If you wish to contact me, you can use GitHub and I am on Twitter @themitchnesbitt.

I'll update this as soon as I can.
